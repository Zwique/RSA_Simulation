# RSA_Simulation
This is aimed at providing basic knowledge of how the RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) works to both encrypt and decrypt the plaintext.

## What is RSA?

## Background
As a part of my Extended Essay, I chose to study the RSA algorithm and outline notiable limitations in terms of key sizes. Along the way of my experimental section, I wrote this Python code to provide more realistic and interesting proofs to my readers about how the length of key sizes affects the efficacy of the algorithm.Â 

## Mechanism
The program gets the following input values: the length of keys that are randomly generated and the text to encrypt into a ciphertext. Additionally, the times spent to complete the tasks are printed at the end of the execution.
